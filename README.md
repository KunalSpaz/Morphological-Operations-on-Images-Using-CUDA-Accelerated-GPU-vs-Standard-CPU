Morphological operations are fundamental techniques in image processing, used primarily for analyzing and processing the geometric structure of images. Two basic operations—dilation and erosion—serve as the foundation for many advanced tasks such as noise removal, shape analysis, and object detection in binary and grayscale images. However, as image sizes increase, especially in applications like satellite imaging, medical imaging, and real-time video processing, traditional CPU-based implementations of these operations become inefficient due to their inherently sequential nature.
This project explores the use of CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) to accelerate morphological operations on GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), comparing their performance against standard CPU implementations. By leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs, we implemented optimized CUDA kernels for both dilation and erosion and evaluated their execution time and scalability. Our findings indicate a significant performance gain when using GPU-based methods, especially for high-resolution images. This work highlights the potential of parallel computing in enhancing the efficiency of fundamental image processing tasks and lays the groundwork for further GPU-accelerated computer vision applications.
